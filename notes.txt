This section calls the toolbar:

	editor.on( 'wptoolbar', function( event ) {
		if ( event.element.nodeName === 'IMG' && ! isPlaceholder( event.element ) ) {
			event.toolbar = toolbar;
		}
	} );

Switching IMG to PRE brought up the image toolbar while clicking on an <pre> tag.

However, copying the whole file into my plugin didn't work. The wpeditimage feature
seems like it must be loading itself specifically as a TinyMCE plugin and thereby
gaining access to more TinyMCE functionality. I'm not sure. Here's a link to a
tutorial on createing TinyMCE plugins for WordPress:
